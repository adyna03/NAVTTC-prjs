this automated google search program uses Selenium; a playback automated browser tool/software that helps you with authoring functional tests without the need to learn a test scripting language.

here i have installed chrome driver (any other browser could be used) in my project directory to automate any no. of automated google searches within a click as per need.
this python code runs only once and can be modified for more than one search.
